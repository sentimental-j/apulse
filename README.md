# Apulse 🚀

Your competitors are online. Why aren’t you?

This is Apulse – a slick, AI-powered website builder that builds sites **faster than you can open a Google Doc**.

## ✨ What’s inside:
- Framer-level visuals (not your grandma’s Bootstrap)
- GPT-powered chat UX (yes, it talks back)
- Real-time device previews: phone, tablet, PC – all that jazz
- Payment flow? Yeah, we got that too
- Contact page? It's literally a GPT in disguise
- Easter egg page? For the culture.

## 📁 Structure

We’ve got:
- `app/`: multipage routes like `contact`, `payment`, and the main show.
- `components/`: the building blocks. Like LEGO, but TypeScript.
- `MockupEngine/`: where the mockup magic + chat previews live.
- `public/`: fonts, backgrounds, vibes.

## 🧪 Still cooking...
- Making AI chat actually smart
- Getting those 10–20 Framer templates in
- Payout system setup
- Locking `.tsx` export for real users only

## 🚧 Dev note
If you’re helping out, keep it clean. We're building a Rolls-Royce, not a go-kart.

> “No more flat-ass landing pages. We’re shipping premium.”
